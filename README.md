    *   **Other Thermal Treatments:** Analysis of processes involving significant heat input (endothermic, potentially misrepresented as 'composting' variants), assessing sustainability, emissions, and alignment with zero waste hierarchies.
    *   **Dehydration/Grinding Systems (e.g., "Compost-Like Output" - CLO):** Analysis of systems that primarily use heat/dehydration and grinding to reduce volume and mass of organic waste, producing a sterile, stabilized output. Evaluating their energy consumption, end-product characteristics (lack of biological decomposition, nutrient profile, stability), potential applications, and crucial distinction from true composting processes.
